## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS

This is my first project so I expect a lot of mistakes. I just learned HTML5 and CSS3 this July, and also learned SASS a while ago for this project.

### What I learned

#### HTML5

  1. To open a page on a new tab - <a href="" target="_blank">

#### CSS3 SASS

  1. Universal/global selector - *
  2. Fonts to be used - @import url('link')
  3. Auto center horizontally - margin: 0 auto;

### Continued development

Will continue to practice Flexbox and Grid in the future. Probably also adding simple transitions like box-shadow when hovered.

### Useful resources

- [Learn Sass In 20 Minutes | Sass Crash Course](https://youtu.be/Zz6eOVaaelI) - Learned how to operate the basics of SASS for 5 mins before starting project.

## Acknowledgments

After finishing my project, I also checked how other people formatted theirs:
- [QR Code Component by Mr Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BBYPntB-GY)
  - Brief and easy explanations for beginners.

- [QR Code Component by TsbSankara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFyMWwOxHYM)
  - Much more detailed explanations re: the format of the box/card on the page.
  - Also, I missed the box-shadow detail on the reference image. They were able to point this out in their video.

- [Viewport Widths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/width)
  - I haven't studied responsive design yet. I did not know how to use the given widths (mobile and desktop). However, this website helped me get the idea.
